# Everything here may not function as expected worlds beside the PowerPlates server!
# There will be a file path relative to data\powerplate\function to find the files easier.
# The file extention will ALWAYS be .mcfunction
# I will provide which other files uses the incompaditable ones. And most files will be included in either tick.mcfunction or reset.mcfunction
# The "how to fix:" section is only if you want to take time to modify the file
# If you don't want to do that, remove the entire file unless its used somewhere other than tick.mcfunction or reset.mcfunction
# if the files data is present in more than tick or reset, you have to modify that file first
