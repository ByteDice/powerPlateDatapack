# TODO

## CODE
- Balance plate abilities
- make speedster use horizontal velocity too
- rework wither

## CUSTOM COMMANDS (hopefully no plugins)
- /rtp
- /tpa
- /invsee (also for echest, plugin-only)
- TAB (plugin-only)

## OTHER


## FUTURE ADDITIONS
- Add minigame maps





## NOTES
- power possibly too much damage to max-hp ratio
- power no work for other players

- wither no dmg (at least on easy mode)

- health could use group healing instead (maybe?)

- fire maybe too little dmg?
