# What is this?
This is a minecraft datapack where the main content is focused on chestplates that give unique abilities.

Though thats not all, there are plenty more quality of life features such as ranks, custom commands, spawn and pvp regions (may incompaditable with your world), and more! All without a single plugin or mod required!

Every chestplate has a passive and event ability. A passive ability is always active, while an event ability is activated manually and is much stronger, but it has a cooldown. Some examples include:

 * Silent chestplate passive: the wearer is permanently blinded but has a "radar" (particles pointing towards an entity) which can spot entities through walls.

 * Oceanic passive: the wearer is really slow on land, but has water breathing and is extremely agile underwater.

 * Uranium event: you literally become a suicide ~~bomb~~ NUKE.

 * Speedster event: spawns a big tornado which flings everything up in the air.
