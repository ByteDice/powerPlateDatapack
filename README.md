# What is this?
This is a minecraft datapack where the main content is focused on chestplates that give unique abilities.

Though thats not all, there are plenty more quality of life features such as ranks, custom commands, spawn and pvp regions (may incompaditable with your world), and more! All without a single plugin or mod required!

# Open-source
**This is open-source, do whatever you want with it, but do not expect professional quality.**

**NOTE: If you wish to use this datapack for yourself, not all files are compaditable with every world. There will be a list of incompaditable files in** `incompaditable-files.txt` **if you wish to modify/remove them.**
