# What is this?
This is a Minecraft datapack where the main content is focused on chestplates that give unique abilities.

Thats not all, there are plenty of QOL features like ranks, custom commands, spawn and pvp regions *(may incompatible with your world)*, and more! Without a single plugin or mod required!

All chestplates have a **passive** and **event** ability. Passive abilities are *always* active, while event abilities are activated manually and are much stronger, but they have a cooldown.

Examples of these abilities include:
 * **Silent** (passive):
   * The wearer is permanently blinded but can sense entities through walls.
 * **Oceanic** (passive):
   * The wearer is really slow on land, but has water breathing and is extremely agile underwater.
 * **Uranium** (event):
   * BIG KABOOM.
 * **Speedster** (event):
   * Spawns a big tornado which throws everything high up in the air.
