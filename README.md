# What is this?
This is a minecraft datapack where the main content is focused on chestplates that give unique abilities.

Thats not all, there are plenty of QOL features like ranks, custom commands, spawn and pvp regions (may incompatible with your world), and more! Without a single plugin or mod required!

All chestplates have a passive and event ability. Passive abilities are always active, while event abilities are activated manually and are much stronger, but it has a cooldown. Examples of these include:

 * Silent chestplate passive: The wearer is permanently blinded but has a "radar" which spots entities through walls.

 * Oceanic passive: The wearer is really slow on land, but has water breathing and is extremely agile underwater.

 * Uranium event: Big kaboom.

 * Speedster event: Spawns a big tornado which throws everything high up in the air.
